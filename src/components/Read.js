      content: `
        I participated in my very first hackathon and it was an exciting journey!
        Our team had only 48 hours to build something useful. 
        We brainstormed late into the night, argued a little, 
        but pushed through and built a solution we were proud of.
        
        The highlight was pitching to judges â€“ and surprisingly, 
        our project won $100. This was not just about money, 
        but about believing in myself as a developer.`,

      content: `
        I completed a career development course with Hi-Innovator Academic. 
        The program gave me insights on business models, pitching ideas, 
        and aligning technology with real-world needs.

        One of the key lessons was the importance of teamwork 
        and communication in making projects successful. 
        I walked away with more confidence as both a developer and innovator.`,

      date: "May 2025",
      content: `
        Designing and developing the Urban-Tech Engineering Consults website 
        was both challenging and rewarding. I made the site fully responsive 
        using React and Bootstrap, ensuring it works across devices.

        I also implemented smooth animations, a dynamic project section, 
        and an engaging homepage. The feedback was positive, 
        and it inspired me to keep improving my frontend skills.`,
